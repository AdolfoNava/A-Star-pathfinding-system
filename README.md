# A-Star-pathfinding-system
This is a algorithmn demonstration of the A* grid system implemented in Unity 2021
## Things that I have done so far

- Worked through an understanding of the A* algorithmn system and attempted it in Unity 3d scene space.
- Wrote comments within the system I made marked each attempt in the A* system by Versions within the scripts

## Things that need to work on

- Undecided on working on this attempt on the project or move on to another approach with the same style of the grid system
- Want to implement some sort of input of the user to prove that the system could work anywhere within the grid that actually works this time
