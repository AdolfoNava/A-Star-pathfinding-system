# A-Star-pathfinding-system
This is a algorithmn demonstration of the A* grid system implemented in Unity 2021
## Things that I have done so far

- Worked through an understanding of the A* algorithmn system and attempted it in Unity 3d scene space.
- Wrote comments within the system I made marked each attempt in the A* system by Versions within the scripts
- Made a new Version of the A* pathfinding with corrections made to function properly as intended now.

## Things that need to work on

- Create an Navmesh system for environments extremely similar to the scenes in the project already.
- Compare to two types of pathfinding in Unity for performance testing on any given system
